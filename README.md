# What Is Asgard
A 3rd-party script launching tool for Adobe After Effects.

## How to Use Asgard

### Panel Buttons

* Click the `X` button to clear the search box and repopulate the list.
* Click the `S` button to open the settings window.

### Settings Buttons

* Click the `Set New Folder` button to set a new folder location to load scripts.
* Click the `Reset Favorites` to remove all recorded click usage.
* Set your favorite text or emoji to represent commonly clicked scripts.

I use Asgard alongside my [after-effects-scripts](https://github.com/kyletmartinez/after-effects-scripts) repository to quickly use scripts that I don't want to dedicate an entire panel towards (using up valuable Workspace real estate) or create buttons for in Kbar.
