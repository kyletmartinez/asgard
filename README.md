# What Is Asgard
A 3rd-party script launching tool for Adobe After Effects.

## How to Use Asgard

Click the `F` button (folder button) to select a folder for `JSX` scripts. The folder path will be stored in the After Effects preferences for future use.

Search with the search box or scroll to a script you would like to use and double click it to run the script.

Click the `X` button (clear button) to clear the search box and repopulate the list.

## Current Use

I use Asgard alongside my [after-effects-scripts](https://github.com/kyletmartinez/after-effects-scripts) repository to quickly use scripts that I don't want to dedicate a pull panel to or create buttons for in Kbar.

## Todo

The UI isn't 100% responsive so I suspect I may need to build a CEP Extension instead. If so, I can also utilize Node for better file-system integration.
